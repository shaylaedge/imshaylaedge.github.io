        My name is Shayla Edgerton. I was born in Boulder, Colorado and moved to
        kaua'i when I was six. I live in kalaheo but used to live in Lihue. I
        have been going to island school since second grade. I want to go to UH
        Manoa for colledge and be a Marine Biologist. I like the beach
        especially Shipwrecks in poipu. I also like taking pictures. The "film"
        link above are photos I have taken with my film camera.
